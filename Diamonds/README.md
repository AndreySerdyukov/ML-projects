# Diamond Sales Price Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the total sales price of diamonds based on various features. The objective is to develop a model that accurately estimates the price, considering key factors such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and more.

## Goals

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Proper handling of categorical variables such as cut, color, and clarity.
2. **Model Training**: Build a regression model that predicts the total sales price based on the features provided.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The quality of the model will be evaluated using the **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** metric.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Explore and transform features to improve model performance.
