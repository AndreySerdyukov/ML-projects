# Wine Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. By analyzing factors such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol, the goal is to develop a model that can reliably predict the quality of a wine.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

- **fixed acidity**: The fixed acidity of the wine (usually tartaric acid).
- **volatile acidity**: The volatile acidity of the wine (commonly acetic acid).
- **citric acid**: The amount of citric acid in the wine.
- **residual sugar**: The amount of residual sugar in the wine (measured in grams per liter).
- **chlorides**: The concentration of chlorides in the wine.
- **free sulfur dioxide**: The free sulfur dioxide content in the wine.
- **total sulfur dioxide**: The total sulfur dioxide content in the wine.
- **density**: The density of the wine.
- **pH**: The pH level of the wine.
- **sulphates**: The concentration of sulphates in the wine.
- **alcohol**: The alcohol content of the wine.
- **quality**: The target variable representing wine quality on a scale from 0 (bad) to 10 (excellent).

## Goals

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle numerical and categorical features appropriately, ensuring that the data is ready for model training.
2. **Model Training**: Train a model that predicts the quality of wine based on the available features.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Use relevant metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) to evaluate the model's performance and ensure it can predict wine quality accurately.
4. **Feature Importance**: Identify which features are most influential in predicting wine quality.

## Special Considerations

- **Handling Missing Data**: Ensure that missing or incomplete data points are handled correctly (imputation, removal, etc.).
- **Outliers**: Identify and address any outliers, especially since wine quality might be sensitive to extreme values in certain features like alcohol or sulfur dioxide levels.
- **Model Evaluation**: Consider using techniques such as cross-validation to assess model robustness and performance.
